# Update ro-pe


- v podstatě nic nového, čeká se na vesnici od Martina
- učesán/přepsán kód [work in progress] 


- model každou púlnoc volá callback funkci, která může přestavět graf 

(+ změnit parametry modelu)

possible TASKs for friends:

- utilities for plotting the results (plot history series, possibly over several runs) 
- command line interface + config file (uses click + configparser so trivial to implement),  

but is not fool-proof (typo in config file may  remain undetected, etc.)

- database of finished experiments - collecting setups + output files
# Implementation
- custom models 
#             MODEL = ENGINE + MODEL_DEFINITION 
****        - ENGINE - zatim jen  verze dle holandanu  (jiny engine = vymena base class)
        - MODEL_DEFINITION - lze nadefinovat 
            - seznam stavu
            - seznam moznych prechodu
            - parametry modelu (co se pak davaj do konstruktoru)
            - funkce na vypocet propensities
            -  
    - engine v podstate pouzivame kod od holandanu, jen jsem zrusila checkpoints (zatim),
        misto toho mozno nastavit callback function, ktera se pak vola kazdou pulnoc a umoznuje predelat graf, zmenit parametry, klidne i dodat jinou funkci na vypocet propensit 
         [in progress] 
    - model defintion - mame  nas extended graf  (extended = pridali jsme holandanum stavy)

## History of events 
    - model keeps record of all events (node number, original state, new state) 
    - not possible what Martin wanted (the model is not simulation ! we do not know
    why the node changed the state (i.e. where and exactly from whom got infection. In reality, we also do not know.)  The history of events of type “Node X had contact  Node Y on layer T and got infection” would require another engine, ie. simcity-like simulation. 
    - implementing another engine and plugin into the current code should be possible [probably not yet, code in progress]
    

function tell_the_story converts history record to text:
